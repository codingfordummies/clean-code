Development
===========

Getting setup
-------------

To get setup as a developer, we recommend the following steps (if any of these tools are unfamiliar, please see the resources in :ref:`this development tools section <zeb-development-tools>`):

#. Install make and ensure that you have Python3 installed
#. Make sure the tests pass by running ``make test``


Building the docs
-----------------

The docs are built using ``make docs``. This command will build the docs, including all compilation of files from yaml files etc.
