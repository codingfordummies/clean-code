Other comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[update based on stuff in netCDFSCM] If Zeb were to write this, his comments would be:

    #. tests

        - these are your sanity checks, every scientist is trained to do them, computers should be no different

    #. make (or other automatic build software)

        - check that your workflows are reproducible, it will help you (piece of mind if a computer dies) and other researchers

    #. continuous integration

        - let someone else do the hardwork of running all the tests for you

    #. ask for help from a software engineer

        - they're worth it, even if they're not around that long

    #. autodocs/sphinx

        - writing documentation is hard, let it be built for you if you can
