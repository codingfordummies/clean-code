  [update based on stuff in netCDFSCM] If Zeb were to write this, his comments would be:

      #. tests

          - these are your sanity checks, every scientist is trained to do them, computers should be no different

      #. make (or other automatic build software)

          - check that your workflows are reproducible, it will help you (piece of mind if a computer dies) and other researchers

      #. continuous integration

          - let someone else do the hardwork of running all the tests for you

      #. ask for help from a software engineer

          - they're worth it, even if they're not around that long

      #. autodocs/sphinx

          - writing documentation is hard, let it be built for you if you can
