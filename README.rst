Clean Code
==========

Welcome to our shared Git repository. Here we store a bunch of notes, code snippets,
makefiles etc. from our own experience getting into the world of computers, code and
software engineering.

Overview
--------

Here we provide a brief overview of the repository structure to get you started, from
there things are hopefully fairly obvious (if not, make a pull request or start an
issue to help us fix this!).

- reading
    - a collection of recommended resources with some of our comments
- software-tips-and-tricks
    - our favourite tips and tricks for using various bits of software


Contributing
------------

If you'd like to contribute, please make a pull request!

As we get more and more complex, we will include more things in the repository. For
now, we have a few key setup elements [todo, add resources on these elements]:
``Makefile``, virtual environment, versioneer and our ``docs`` folder but nothing else.
