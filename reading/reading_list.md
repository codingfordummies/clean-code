# Reading List

Issues to make once we start our repo:

- how we categorise things, do we need some system e.g. classifying how essential reading is, whether stuff is a website or a book, whether it's free or not, how long it takes to read, how easy it is to use etc. etc.? 
- whether we limit this doc only to e.g. overview books/websites/resources and put all other 'help' resources only next to where the advice is e.g. a resource on git would go in `software-tips-and-tricks` --> `version-control` --> `git`, next to where it is relevant and not here to ensure we keep things close to where they're useful and only mention them once?

## Resources

Issue to make: we could use a common syntax (e.g. yaml or json) for documenting resources and then write a quick conversion script to get them into a common format below (ensures we don't make typos/have inconsistent formatting).
